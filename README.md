## Description
This was built using MERN Stack Single-Page Application, React, ANT framework and custom CSS,  GraphQL, Node.js, Express.js server, MongoDB, Web API’s.

Mind-Mash is a web based trivia game which uses an external trivia api to deliver questions to the user. The user score is then totalled using MongoDB so users can keep consistent track of their Trivia Aptitude. It uses React for the front end, GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server, MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database, and queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data. User login info is authenticated using JWT.
