# Project-3-MIND-MASH
For the EDX U of M full stack bootcamp.

a user story is needed which describes all prospective functions of our site, ie, home page, login, profile, quiz module, friends list, etc

## USER Story 

As A developer,
I want to integrate a Trivia-App API that provides trivia quiz, questions, categories, and answers,
So that I can dynamically display trivia content to users in a quiz application.

AS A developer looking to deploy the application automatically to Render when code is merged from develop to main,
I WANT to create a GitHub Action that will run when the code is merged to main and automatically deploys to Render
SO THAT the application is constantly updated when major releases are made to the main branch.



## Description: MERN Stack Single-Page Application, React, MongoDB, GraphQL , Node.js/Express.js server, and API 

The Octoploid group will be using everything we've learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide us with the best opportunity to demonstrate our problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that we create, but our project must fulfill the following requirements:

React for the front end, GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server, MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database, queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data. This will be deployed using Render (with data). At least one GitHub Action will be used in the project repository. With a polished UI. App must be responsive, and interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input). to Include authentication (JWT). Protect sensitive API key information on the server. Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.). Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Installation

To complete the assignment, you'll need to do the following:

Install `React`, `MongoDB`, `GraphQL`,`Node.js/Express.js server`, and `API`

Configure `React, MongoDB for  both component` `and` `end-to-end testing`

Create a `component test for the quiz component.`

Create an `end-to-test` for the `quiz component.`
 
## Usage

To use the MIND-MASH APP locally you will run:

???? `npm run build`

????? `npm run start:dev` Doing this will allow you to open this locally.

Running the command `npm run test` will run the `cypress test` in the terminal.

Running the command `npm run cypress` will open `cypress` and you're able to run the test there.

## Contribution
Contribution is welcome and also feel free to download, fork, use, and play with the codes as desired.

## Tests
To test the code, initiate the server by executing the command ??????`npm run server:dev`. Subsequently, open a separate terminal and run the command ???`npm run test`. This action will execute the component test `Quiz.cy.tsx` as well as the end-to-end test `quiz.cy.ts`. With the server still operational, you may run `npm run cypress`, provided that it is installed. This will launch Cypress, from which you can conduct both the Component and end-to-end tests.
